"""
This extension counts nested control structures within a function.

The extension is implemented with C++ and Python in mind,
but it is expected to work with other languages supported by Lizard
with its language reader implementing 'nesting_level' metric for tokens.

The code borrows heavily from implementation of Nesting Depth extension
originally written by Mehrdad Meh and Terry Yin.

        provided by language readers.
        If the following contract for the nesting level metric does not hold,
        this implementation of nested structure counting is invalid.

        If a control structure has started its block (e.g., '{'),
        and its level is **less** than the next structure,
        the next structure is nested.

        If a control structure has *not* started its block,
        and its level is **no more** than the next structure,
        the next structure is nested (compound statement).

        If a control structure level is **higher** than the next structure,
        it is considered closed.

        If a control structure has started its block,
        and its level is **equal** to the next structure,
        it is considered closed.

        The level of any non-structure tokens is treated
        with the same logic as for the next structures
